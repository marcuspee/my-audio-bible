## Setting Up

Setting up for our church services can be broken down into several intervals/steps.

This can be boiled down to :
1. Unpacking / Placement
2. Cabling / Connecting
4. Configuration / Testing
5. Operation

## Packing Down
In the same manner, packing down after church services can be broken down into similar steps

These include :
1. Powering down (important!)
2. Cable rolling
3.  Consolidating / Packing Up
4. Storage

> During packdown, there is not necessarily an order in which the above takes place, as many of these can happen over the same period.
> It is advised that expensive, small items or "walkables" - named aptly so due to the attractive nature of said items to be "walked" away by a motivated individual, be packed and stored promptly whilst the other steps are commenced.


Lets explore *some* of the **basics of setting up** with some principles in mind...


### The Key to a *good* Set Up

What is a "good" setup? Objectively, it is one that meets all the below criteria, and then some.
1. It is neat, safe, and organised
	1. This ensures safety (no trip hazards) and the ability to quickly troubleshoot in the event something stops working
	2. Organisation is key, as the whole system can be quite a challenge to grasp hold of when there is an issue. 
2. Simple, robust solutions
	1. Are the connections not solid? Will a twist or a small tug cause an issue to anyone?
	2. Are all settings and configurations understood by all members of the team? If its too complicated, create simple diagrams or minimal configuration in those aspects of the setups.
3. It is easy to pack up.
	1. We always want to think about the pack up, WHEN we are still setting up.
	2. Are we laying all our cables in one place to get tangled? Future you will not enjoy that. Is there a better way of running our cables that may be out of the way of passer-by's during the packdown? How can we be more efficient with our runs?

These are all broad-thinking principles, but they all work to one common goal. 
You will find that a good setup will look different for any different team, but there is always one that is optimal in the current situation, and we want to aim for **THAT**.

We will look at some diagrams and pictures to further expand on some of these setup principles and guides.
