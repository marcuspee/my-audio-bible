# Introduction
As the title suggests, Digital Audio is the term we use for audio (that is sound) that is in the digital form.

We covered in the [[Church Training/Basics of Audio\|Basics of Audio]] that sound can exist in the physical, analogue and digital form.
In this note we will cover Digital Audio, what it is, how it works, and how we can fully utilise it.
