# Introduction

It is a very basic question, but we begin our journey by answering the simple ones and work our way to complex, in-depth questions as our foundation in our knowledge grows.

> Only when we master the basics, can we truly deeply learn the complex.

So what is sound? Sound as we know it, is the vibration of air particles. That translates to vibrations to our eardrums, which then transfers the energy to tiny nerve endings inside our ear and that is perceived as sound!

That is simple enough, no?


Lets dive **deeper.** 

Now that we know that sound is vibrations, how does the vibrations move along the air?

When something makes a sound, it vibrates - let's just take a speaker in example.
The diaphragm of the speaker moves forward and backwards, at many times per second. This movement vibrates the air in front and behind of it, by pushing and pulling the air many times a second.

This causes the air to compress and de-compress multiple times per second!! That is quite a concept if you think about it.

When the air is compressed by the speaker pushing forward, we call that part of the "wave" a compression.

When the air is de-compressed by the speaker pulling backward, we call that part of the "wave" a rarefaction.

So instead of a wave that looks like this...

The wave of sound looks a bit more like this!

You can observe that instead of waves going up and down, the vibrations can be visualised as pressure waves that has more air particles, or less.


**IF** the sound was loud enough and low frequency enough, you can actually feel the sound "hit" you - and you probably have already! If you have been at a concert or church service where there is a large enough subwoofer, you often *feel* the bass just as much as you hear it. 


> [!info] Info
> Subwoofers were designed for low frequencies, these go down to 20Hz, sometimes even lower!
> Frequencies these low are often felt more than you hear them, especially at louder volumes.



You don't hear the sound because it goes up and down, you hear it because the air is compressing and rarefacting and that change in pressure is detected by your ears.

That is the basics, and then some, of what SOUND is.

I hope you learnt something and found that fascinating! Why did we learn this? Because much later down the line, knowing HOW sound works is important in making things sound better! We will cover that and revisit this when the time is right.

## Mic Level, Line Level

So we discussed what sound is!
That is what we call **physical** sound. 

When we capture sound, we do so either in the Analogue or the Digital realm.
Let's stick to analogue for now, as the [[Church Training/Digital Audio\|Digital Audio]] realm is going to be a whole thing by itself. 

Analogue audio is basically audio, in the form of electricity.
Let's get an example up.

When we sing into a microphone, we are transferring physical sound (which we now know is compression and rarefaction) into the microphone diaphragm. This moves forward and backward (much like a speaker does) and where a speaker converts an electrical signal to physical sound, a microphone just does the exact in reverse!

> [!tip] Tip
> Since a speaker and a microphone work in almost the same way (but in reverse) there are multiple cool inventions out there by audio engineers! These include but are not limited to:
> - Wiring an old phone into a microphone
> - Wiring an old speaker cone in reverse, as a huge microphone to capture the kick drum
> - Wiring an old microphone in reverse to create a boxy, small, bad sounding speaker


The result is a (very tiny) electrical signal sent out of the microphone's output through the cable, to whatever receiving device on the other end - usually a mixing console or preamp..

We can also just send a signal out of the mixing console to a speaker, and the physical cable might be the same, an XLR cable, but the signal coming out of the console is MUCH MUCH louder than just the signal coming from a cable!

I will point you to an article written by professionals in the industry, and it's a short detour to learn more about Mic level, Line level, and even Aux level!

In review, mic level, line level and aux level is the quick way of determining how strong a signal is, and therefore we should be mindful and think about how we are getting signal from one device to another!

>[!warning] Warning!
>Line level is MUCH hotter (louder) than mic level. Therefore plan and know how things are plugged in before muting/unmuting channels.
>In example, if a line level input was plugged directly into a microphone preamp and the gain is turned up for a **microphone** level signal, the input will clip and be very loud and can damage equipment and/or cause hearing loss!
