# [Thresholds](https://marcuspee.wordpress.com/2017/04/01/thresholds/)

threshold

> the magnitude or intensity that must be exceeded for a certain reaction, phenomenon, result, or condition to occur or be manifested.

I’d like to cover a little bit about threshold(s).

In the audio world, you will see this term in numerous places.

1. Compressors/Limiters
2. Expanders/Gates
3. Dynamic EQs/Multiband Compressors

To each – you will understand that the threshold of those tools/processing is almost like a measuring point ; at which in comparison to where the signal is to the threshold, will the compressor/limiter/gate/expander/etc choose to react accordingly based on the other parameters of said signal processor.

That might seem like a lot of mumbo jumbo to some – (I hope it did, I tried rather hard) but it boils down to just this.

The threshold is where you measure up something, to which… you know what, just read that definition provided by google up there. Yay search engines!

There are so many ways we decide on how to set our thresholds in our signal processing. Here’s how I use my threshold settings on my compressors and gates in attempt to keep this post from being too lengthy.

Compressor/Limiter Thresholds

I first decide my ratio, attack and release values. These would depend on the source that I am choosing to compress/limit. An extremely dynamic and loose vocal will have largely different values to a well played bass guitar with too much string noise.

I will then choose to do one of the following :

- dial down the compressor’s threshold to start compressing at ~1db at optimal signal level and watch it go to a a max of ~5db at the loudest moments (control of dynamics)
- dial the threshold to start a minimal compression at ~4db with set attack and release times. I of course, make sure that there is enough gain compensation after the compression (tonal control)

 I do a lot more with compressors with various techniques and goals in mind – these are just the most common ways I set my threshold. 

Gate/Expander Thresholds

I almost never find myself using a hard gate. It’s always an expander. Gates are just so unnatural, I ever only use it if it’s an effect I’m looking for. 

I seem to only have one way of setting my threshold for expanders. I set my ratio, range, attack and release values and then work my threshold up to the point where I want to clean the audio up. Some expanded have two thresholds to set, one to open up the gate/expander, and another one which the signal has to fall under before it closes up again. Those are my favourite kind. It gives me more control in retaining the natural timbre and tail of the signal. 

I love talking about how I process sound and my signal chain for several different sources. More on that in the next post (very technical – geeks will enjoy)

I also love talking about personal growth and to encourage people to see potential in themselves. Usually under new light.   
**What is your threshold?**

At what point does something need to affect your life before you start doing something about it? 

It’s a day and age where we settle a lot for “good enough” and apparently we need a kick in the behind before we get going for better. 

Do you try to kick a bad habit when you first notice it might be a problem in your future? When you realise it’s not the person you want to be? Or is it when you finally get stuck in it and it becomes a huge struggle to quit?   
Is the longing to get better at your craft or skill set dampened once you go past a point? Is your goal too low that you achieved all you wanted and have nothing much else to aspire to? 

I found that my personal thresholds have changed over the years. They’ve only kept climbing. 

You will find that as you grow, your thresholds that seem so far away, they close in and there’s always room for more. If you don’t adjust your threshold constantly in your life, you’re always just going to be limiting yourself to the potential that you’ve allowed yourself that time ago. 

I’m challenging you, reader. Do not be complacent with where you are and what you do – we all hit a threshold sometime. A reaction happens. Adjust. Respond. Grow. 

Don’t set and forget.
