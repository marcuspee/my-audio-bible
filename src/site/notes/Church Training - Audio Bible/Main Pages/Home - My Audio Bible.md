# Welcome
This is the start of a not-so-complete documentation for learning about sound, ministry and the combination of both to build a strong ministry and relationship with Christ.

It is a very active work in progress so bear with it while I make changes and updates to this digital garden of notes.

I highly recommend starting at [[Church Training - Audio Bible/Main Pages/Training Modules\|Training Modules]], as they will lead you to a more comprehensive "menu" to what this note depository can offer. Do feel free to look at some handy links below - these will change from time to time, highlighting some different resources to look at as I build it.
